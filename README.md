# DragQueenBestFriend
If you love drag queens as much as I do then THIS is the quiz for you! Respond to the ten questions about all things drag and get matched with one of RuPaul's darlings. Are you more of an Alyssa or a Katya? You're gonna find out, henny!

## Description

## Feedback
This app is moldable - currently, any user input is appended to the current list of drag queens. However, for practicle application, I would choose to NOT have that be the case. I'd rather have control over what or who is available for a user's match.
